# Hollow Clock
 This project is derived from (shiura's Hollow Clock 3)[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5142739]
 I also used the (remix for the Wemos D1 Mini)[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5160250]

# Intnded Modifications
 My intention is to modify this significantly:
  - utilize PlatformIO (I'm not a fan of the Arduino IDE)
  - use standard libraries (such as AccelStepper and NTP)
  - eventually add some kind of feedback to "close the loop" for more accurate time
